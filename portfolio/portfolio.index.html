            <h3>About me;</h3>
             <p>I have had the opportunity to explore many different work environments, giving me the ability to relate to lots of diverse people. I went back to school at age 55, and have totally enjoyed the experience. I strive to empower the people I work with to become what they envision. I have been a crafter all my life. 
             My father used to yell at me to put the tools away when I was young. I painted and did pencil art in high school, along with mechanical drawing. I got more into crafts with different mediums after I had children. I have always loved to garden, and paint the inside of my house in many colors. I look forward to working with you and brining all that I have to the screen.

Depending on your target audience there is so many ways to express ones self, that it is nearly impossible to have identical web sites out there.
